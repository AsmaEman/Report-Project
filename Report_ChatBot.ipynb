For example, it states that in imposing a sentence under this section, it is considered an aggravating circumstance if the defendant's underlying felony was committed on or within 1,000 feet of specified schools. Additionally, separate criminal street gang enhancements may be applied to gang crimes committed against separate victims at different times and places, with multiple criminal intents. The section also provides specific punishments for offenses committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang and with the intent to promote criminal conduct by gang members. However, there are certain limitations and exceptions to the application of these enhancements, such as in cases of crimes punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or when the offense is a misdemeanor made a felony pursuant to section 186.22(d).\n"
